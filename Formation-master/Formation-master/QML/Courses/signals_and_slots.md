**Signals and Slots** are core concepts in QML and the broader Qt framework. They provide a powerful mechanism for communication between objects, allowing for a flexible and decoupled architecture.

### **Signals in QML**

A **signal** is a way to notify that something has happened. In QML, signals are used to communicate between different components or objects when an event occurs.

#### Defining a Signal
You can define a custom signal in a QML file using the `signal` keyword. For example:

```qml
Rectangle {
    width: 200
    height: 200

    signal clicked()

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: clicked()  // Emit the clicked signal when the area is clicked
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Rectangle` component defines a custom signal called `clicked`.
- Inside the `MouseArea`, when the `onClicked` event handler is triggered (i.e., when the user clicks within the area), it emits the `clicked` signal.

### **Slots in QML**

A **slot** is a function that can be called in response to a particular signal. In QML, any JavaScript function can act as a slot. When a signal is emitted, connected slots (functions) are executed.

#### Connecting Signals to Slots
To connect a signal to a slot in QML, you typically use an `onSignalName` handler:

```qml
Rectangle {
    width: 200
    height: 200

    signal clicked()

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: clicked()  // Emit the clicked signal when the area is clicked
    }

    onClicked: {
        console.log("Rectangle clicked!")
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `onClicked` signal handler listens for the `clicked` signal.
- When `clicked` is emitted, the function inside `onClicked` is executed, printing "Rectangle clicked!" to the console.

### **Connecting Signals and Slots Across Components**

Signals and slots can also connect components across different parts of your QML application. For example:

```qml
// Button.qml
Rectangle {
    width: 100
    height: 50
    color: "lightblue"

    signal buttonPressed()

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: buttonPressed()
    }

    Text {
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        text: "Press Me"
    }
}
```

```qml
// Main.qml
Rectangle {
    width: 400
    height: 300

    Button {
        id: myButton
        anchors.centerIn: parent

        onButtonPressed: {
            console.log("Button was pressed!")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Button.qml` defines a `buttonPressed` signal.
- In `Main.qml`, when the button is pressed, the `onButtonPressed` handler responds to the signal by logging "Button was pressed!".

### **Using Signals and Slots for Component Communication**

Signals and slots are particularly useful for:
- **Decoupling components:** Components don't need to know about each other's implementation details; they just need to know how to respond to signals.
- **Reacting to user input:** Signals can be emitted in response to user actions (like clicks or key presses), and slots can define the appropriate behavior.
- **Creating reusable components:** By defining custom signals, you can make your components more reusable and modular.

### **Summary**

- **Signals** are emitted when something happens, like a user interaction.
- **Slots** are functions that are executed in response to signals.
- In QML, any JavaScript function can be used as a slot.
- Signals and slots provide a clean way to handle events and communication between QML components, promoting a modular and maintainable code structure.
